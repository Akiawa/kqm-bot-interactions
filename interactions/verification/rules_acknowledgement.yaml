2. Controversial topics (religion, politics, etc.) are not allowed in chat, usernames, PFPs or user banners. Spamming is not tolerated.

3. KQM is an English-speaking community so we ask that you try to use English the majority of the time unless the actual topic relates to a foreign language.

4. All NSFW should be kept inside the NSFW section. Sharing adult graphic content outside of NSFW category will be punished. NSFW PFPs are not allowed. 

5. Sexism, Racism, Lolicon, Pedophilia, Xenophobia, Gore and other graphic content are prohibited. 

6. Commercial promotion and solicitation (for in-game or real money) and advertising of non-partnered servers is strictly prohibited. Any Genshin account trading or selling is forbidden. 

7. We will also issue punishment if we deem there has been serious rule-breaking in our partnered servers.

8. Theorycrafting of any un-released content (pre-TC) is not permitted. Please see [this announcement](https://discord.com/channels/763583452762734592/764396637165584384/873649108894765107) for more information on what counts as pre-tc.
